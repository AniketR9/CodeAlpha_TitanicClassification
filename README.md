Task 1 of internship with CodeAlpha done!

I successfully completed a survival prediction using Logistic Regression on the Titanic Dataset.
The dataset used can be found on both Kaggle and GitHub.
Dataset URL:
GitHub:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv
Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

Thank you to CodeAlpha for giving me this opportunity. The given task was actually a great learning experience for me
